# Regression Analysis Project: Predictive Modeling to Minimize RMSE

## Authors
- Shachar Lev Tov
- Daria Triffon

## Overview
This repository contains code, datasets, and other resources used in our regression analysis project. Our primary objective is to develop a predictive model that minimizes the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for a given set of test data.

### Algorithms Used
- k-Nearest Neighbors
- Regression Trees
- Lasso Regression

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Folder containing the training and test datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- `src/`: Source code for utility functions and custom algorithms.
- `output/`: Folder for storing prediction results and metrics.


## Results
Our final model achieved an RMSE of `XX.XX` on the test set. Further details can be found in the [Project Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tIXeV3bZ6SR-5HhjHxH1BFxQJz19aeUfg5kwWmlSxr8/edit?usp=sharing).
